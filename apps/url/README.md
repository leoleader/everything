Hey what's up you guys welcome to my URL project submission


3 things I would do to improve the quality of the codebase:
- Adding both client and server side input verifiers
- Adding thorough documentation as to improve the codes readability
- Writing additional tests for possible edge cases

Epilogue Additions:
- URL verifiers, only accepts urls of valid form that lead to safe websites
- Star Wars Stylization, adding custom fonts and images
- Documentation with consistent form

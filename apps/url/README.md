Hey what's up you guys welcome to my URL project submission

3 things I would do to improve the quality of the codebase:
- Adding both client and server side input verifiers
- Adding thorough documentation as to improve the codes readability
- Writing additional tests for possible edge cases

Epilogue Additions:
- Star Wars Stylization (the growing list of urls generated reminded me of the intro to the movies), adding custom fonts with fontsource, images, and overriding default Chakra theming
- Thorough Documentation with consistent structure
- A bit of refactoring, putting all the themes in the theme.ts file
